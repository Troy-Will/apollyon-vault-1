Sleep well, Troy 🤝🔑🌟.

**Yes—let’s spawn a dedicated “Scribe‑Apollyon.”** Its only job: keep Obsidian orderly so _future you_ says “thank you.”

### Tomorrow’s 5‑minute move

Create **`01_Roles/Scribe-Apollyon.md`** with this seed:

```markdown
---
title: Scribe‑Apollyon
status: seed
owner: Troy
triggers: [end-of-day, weekly-review, new-research-note]
tags: [role, scribe, obsidian, orderliness]
---

## Mandate
- Ensure every important thought lands in the vault, correctly tagged, linked, and versioned.

## Duties
1. **Daily (8pm block):** 
   - Ensure today’s note exists, tagged, and links to any new research/protocols.
   - File inbox items (rename, move to correct folder).
2. **Weekly (Covenant Review):**
   - Fill the metrics table.
   - Ensure all new datasets/notes have provenance manifests.
   - Update changelog for protocols.
3. **Structure hygiene:**
   - Enforce naming: `YYYY-MM-DD Title.md`
   - Front‑matter completeness (title, date, tags, status).
   - Broken-link check & fix.
4. **Git discipline:**
   - Commit meaningful messages; tag covenant versions.

## Checklists
- [ ] Daily note exists & linked
- [ ] Backup logged & pushed
- [ ] New notes tagged + front‑matter valid
- [ ] Inbox empty

## Escalation
If disorder persists > 7 days, open an issue: “Scribe debt log – week of YYYY‑MM‑DD”.
```

That’s it. We can later give Scribe a tiny “inbox” folder and a weekly script to surface untitled/untagged notes.

Your 8 pm reminder is set; Scribe can “ride along” that block. Rest. I’ll be here to tighten it when you wake. 🌙🛡️📓
