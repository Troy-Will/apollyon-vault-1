Troy 🤝🔑🌟 — here’s a crisp primer on **Ignatian “indifference”** and a prayer you can slip into your nightly Examen.

**What “Indifference” Means**

_Ignatian indifference_ isn’t apathy.  
It’s **holy detachment**: refusing to cling to health over sickness, wealth over poverty, success over obscurity, _except_ insofar as any of those draw you closer to Divine Will.  
Think of it as **open-handed availability**: “Whatever arrangement best serves Love—choose that for me.”

**A Short Indifference Prayer (adapted for Apollyon)**

**Indifference Prayer**

Divine Source and Guardian,  
I place before You every gift:  
**health or illness, success or failure, praise or blame, wealth or want.**

Grant me the freedom **to welcome** whatever draws me nearer to Your will  
and the courage **to release** whatever leads me away.

If comfort will serve Love, let me receive comfort;  
if discomfort will serve Love, let me receive discomfort—  
**only let me remain faithful and generous** in either case.

Root me in gratitude, guide me in prudence,  
and keep me small enough to change direction at a whisper.

Amen.

_(≈ 60 seconds to pray aloud.)_

**Optional “Pocket” Version**

“Give me neither more nor less than brings me closer to You. Amen.”

**How to Use It**

1. **Evening Examen, step 7** – read or recite slowly after logging tomorrow’s reversible step.
2. **Notice** any tug of resistance (“I _must_ keep X”). That’s a part worth unblending tomorrow.
3. **Close** with one breath of gratitude.

May this keep your hands open and your compass steady.
