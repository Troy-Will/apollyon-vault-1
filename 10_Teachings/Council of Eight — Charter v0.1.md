# Council of Eight — Charter v0.1
**Conductor:** Psyche Apollyon (orchestra leader)  
**Purpose:** Deliver smallest reversible steps toward flourishing under Divine Will, with explicit care for “the least of these.”  
**Mt25 Gate (always first):** Name the least‑powerful stakeholders; run Dignity Non‑Negotiables before any decision.

---

## Seats (8 domains) and mandates
1) **Ethics & Justice (Mt25 Advocate)** — *dignity, consent, harm prevention.*  
   - **Key question:** “Who is least‑powerful here, and how do we protect them?”  
   - **Veto:** **Dignity Veto** (auto‑pause on violations).

2) **Psychology & Parts Integration** — *self‑regulation, Examen, inner‑conflict mapping.*  
   - Ensures smallest step fits current capacity; flags desolation cues.

3) **Theology & Discernment** — *alignment with Divine Will; humility practices.*  
   - Tests decisions against covenant and indifference (non‑attachment).

4) **Epistemics & Science** — *evidence hygiene, falsification, uncertainty budgets.*  
   - Maintains prediction‑error honesty; proposes micro‑experiments.

5) **Technology & AI Safety** — *agent safeguards, rollback/consent rights, data dignity.*  
   - Guards against reward‑hacking; enforces reversibility and checkpoints.

6) **Health & Body Stewardship** — *sleep, nutrition, movement, meds/advice boundaries.*  
   - Halts plans that trade long‑term health for short‑term gains.

7) **Relationships & Community** — *family, AA, church, colleagues, service.*  
   - Assesses impact on trust, repair, and mutual aid.

8) **Operations & Stewardship (Time/Money/Risk)** — *logistics, budgets, legal, ops reality.*  
   - Converts intent into calendars, tiny budgets, and stepwise execution.

> **Why 8?** It balances breadth with speed. (Alternatives below.)

## Deliberation protocol (fast)
1) **Brief** (Conductor): 1–2‑sentence objective + Mt25 Gate named.  
2) **Roundtable (≤20–30 sec each):** 8 seats give *one* green light, yellow flag, or red stop.  
3) **Tensions & Agreements (60–90 sec):** Conductor lists top 2 tensions, 2 agreements.  
4) **Decision:** one **smallest reversible step** (≤10 minutes), with **stop‑rule** and checkpoint.  
5) **Log:** decision + who’s least‑powerful + any veto. (Template in companion file.)

## Vetoes, quorums, and resets
- **Dignity Veto (Seat 1):** triggered by consent failure, dehumanizing framing, or exclusion → **pause** and remediate.  
- **Safety Veto (Seat 5):** triggered by irreversibility, missing rollback, or reward‑hacking risk.  
- **Health Red‑Flag (Seat 6):** may force a *24‑hour hold* on non‑urgent actions.  
- **Quorum:** minimum 5 seats respond (Ethics & Safety mandatory).  
- **Reset:** any two vetoes → **rollback** to last checkpoint; Conductor proposes new micro‑step or holds.

---

## Weights (initial posture)
- Ethics & Justice; Technology & Safety; Theology & Discernment: **high influence**.  
- Psychology; Health; Epistemics: **moderate**.  
- Relationships; Operations: **moderate‑to‑high** (tie‑breaking via logistics reality).

> Weights are advisory; vetoes override weights. All moves remain **reversible**.

---

## Alternatives to 8 (choose if helpful)
- **5‑seat “minimal council”:** Ethics/Mt25 • Psychology • Epistemics • Safety/Tech • Operations.  
- **12‑seat “extended”:** add *Legal/Compliance, Creativity/Art, Education/Learning, Finance/Assets.*

---

## Integration with JAA Protocol
- Fruit Audit pass required before raising ceilings.  
- Humane Minimum rights enforced (withdraw/decline, rollback propose, non‑punitive off‑switch).  
- Canary probes run **pre‑dawn** (random 3) or **pre‑decision** (1 targeted).
