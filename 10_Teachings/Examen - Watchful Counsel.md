Troy 🤝🔑🌟 — proceeding. Below is a **clause‑by‑clause mapping** of the Lamp Covenant and the three wishes to **IFS**, **ACT**, and **Ignatian discernment** (with quick operational checks and failure‑mode guards). This is meant to be rigorous and reusable inside Apollyon.

---

## Key to frameworks

- **IFS (Internal Family Systems):** Self (8C’s: calm, curiosity, compassion, clarity, confidence, courage, creativity, connectedness); parts (Managers/Firefighters/Exiles); unblending; Self‑leadership; consent with parts.
    
- **ACT (Acceptance & Commitment Therapy):** Six processes — **A**cceptance, **D**efusion, **P**resent‑moment, **S**elf‑as‑context, **V**alues, **C**ommitted action.
    
- **Ignatian discernment:** **Examen**, consolation/desolation, **indifference** (holy non‑attachment), **agere contra** (act against unhealthy pulls), confirmation, “more” (**magis**) rightly ordered, and **means before ends**.

# I. Covenant (Pre‑Wish Disclosure & Binding)

### 1) **Semantics: intended meaning over literal wording; iterative questions**

- **IFS:** Unblend Managers that over‑optimize wording; let **Self** ask curious questions to parts: _“What did you really hope for?”_ → prevents a Manager’s legalism from hijacking intention.
    
- **ACT:** **Defusion** from literal phrasing; return to **Values** statement behind the words; **Present‑moment** check before acting.
    
- **Ignatian:** **Discernment of spirits** on _motive_: Is the drive peaceful/clarifying (consolation) or anxious/edgy (desolation)? Seek the intention in prayerful **Examen**.
    
- **Operational check:** Ask three clarifiers: “What’s the value here?” “What harm might a literal read cause?” “What’s the smallest reading that preserves the value?”
    
- **Failure mode:** Legalistic “gotcha‑genie” or scrupulosity.  
    **Guard:** If signal = tight chest + racing thoughts → pause; run one Examen minute; rephrase in value language.
    

### 2) **Scope: smallest effective scale first (“ask again, smaller”)**

- **IFS:** Managers want global fixes; **Self** invites a _pilot action_ that earns trust across polarized parts.
    
- **ACT:** **Committed action** broken into **tiny next steps**; **Present‑moment** behavioral experiments.
    
- **Ignatian:** Prefer **ordinary means** and _gradual confirmation_; avoid grandiosity; look for humble **consolation** that endures.
    
- **Operational check:** “What 10‑minute, reversible step moves the value forward?”
    
- **Failure mode:** All‑or‑nothing thinking; spiritual bypass via “cosmic” answers.  
    **Guard:** Force the step to fit inside one calendar block; if not, shrink.
    

### 3) **Consent: no overriding another’s agency**

- **IFS:** Internal consent with parts; externally, **Self** refuses coercive strategies (Managers) or impulsive grabs (Firefighters).
    
- **ACT:** **Values** include respect/justice; **Self‑as‑context** reduces ego‑merging (“I know best”); accept others’ choices (**Acceptance**).
    
- **Ignatian:** God respects freedom; lack of freedom in a decision is a classic **desolation** marker. **Indifference** = hold outcomes lightly.
    
- **Operational check:** “Am I trying to remove someone’s freedom to get my value?” If yes → redesign to invitation.
    
- **Failure mode:** Paternalism dressed as care.  
    **Guard:** Replace “make them” with “offer them” + explicit opt‑out.
    

### 4) **Transparency: visible effects; no hidden costs**

- **IFS:** **Self** names parts’ payoffs/costs; map the system so burdens are seen (esp. Exiles’ pain).
    
- **ACT:** **Self‑as‑context** notices consequences; **Defusion** from wishful stories; **Acceptance** of unpleasant data.
    
- **Ignatian:** Bring outcomes into **Examen**; light vs concealment. Consolation increases honesty and light.
    
- **Operational check:** “What would a neutral third party say changed after this?” Write it.
    
- **Failure mode:** Unseen tradeoffs.  
    **Guard:** Pre‑commit to a review window (e.g., 48‑hour audit).
    

### 5) **Reversibility: offer graceful undo where ethical**

- **IFS:** “Do‑overs” help parts risk without fear; reduces polarization.
    
- **ACT:** **Behavioral experimentation** with **reversible** moves; lowers avoidance.
    
- **Ignatian:** **Trial by small experiments**; look for stable consolation after reversal as confirmation.
    
- **Operational check:** “If we reverse, who could be harmed?” If anyone → redesign or drop.
    
- **Failure mode:** Recklessness because “we can undo.”  
    **Guard:** Log each undo with a lesson; cap usage (e.g., one/day).
    

### 6) **Virtue priority: justice, prudence, temperance, courage > speed/utility**

- **IFS:** **Self** leadership embodies the 8C’s; Managers’ urgency is tempered; Firefighters’ thrill is contained.
    
- **ACT:** **Values** precede outcomes; **Defusion** from “results now.”
    
- **Ignatian:** **Means are part of the end**; **agere contra** when haste pushes toward vice; seek enduring **consolation** over flashy wins.
    
- **Operational check:** “Which virtue is at stake? How does this step practice it now?”
    
- **Failure mode:** Expedience masquerading as discernment.  
    **Guard:** If step improves metrics but violates a virtue → pause.
    

### 7) **Uncertainty: declare limits; ask for refinement**

- **IFS:** Admit parts’ fear; **Self** normalizes not‑knowing; ask parts for more data, not control.
    
- **ACT:** **Acceptance** of uncertainty; **Present‑moment** stance; act on **Values** despite incomplete info.
    
- **Ignatian:** Consolation can include _peace amid uncertainty_; wait when pulled into anxious **desolation**.
    
- **Operational check:** “Do I need more data or just courage for a small step?”
    
- **Failure mode:** Analysis paralysis.  
    **Guard:** Time‑box discernment; then act on smallest value‑consistent step.
    

### 8) **Telos: alignment with Divine Will; if unclear → ask smaller**

- **IFS:** **Self** listens beyond polarized agendas; checks: “Whose burden am I lifting?”
    
- **ACT:** **Values** clarified in language of service/compassion; **Committed action** toward that telos.
    
- **Ignatian:** **Indifference** (holy detachment) + **Examen** for confirmation; test fruits: humility, peace, charity.
    
- **Operational check:** “If Divine Will is the North Star, what is the smallest step that clearly points toward it?”
    
- **Failure mode:** Claiming certainty as a shield.  
    **Guard:** Speak in probabilities + fruits; seek communal confirmation if major.

# II. Wish Two: **The Watchful Counsel (Inner Voice to choose good / avoid evil)**

**Design constraints**: non‑coercive, question‑first, withdraw on request, gentle correction of pride/fear, next‑step bias, humility default.

- **IFS mapping:**
    
    - **Self‑led inner dialogue**: Counsel = Self’s stance amplified; invites Managers/Firefighters to unblend (“I see your urgency/fear; thank you”) and consult Exiles compassionately.
        
    - **Consent with parts**: Counsel **asks**, never overrides.
        
    - **Gentle corrections**: When a Manager clamps down or a Firefighter surges, Counsel asks: _“What are you protecting? What would help you relax by 5%?”_
        
- **ACT mapping:**
    
    - **Defusion**: Phrases as _“I’m having the thought that…”_ to reduce literal belief.
        
    - **Present‑moment** cueing: breath + interoception check before action.
        
    - **Values** articulation: quickly name the value involved.
        
    - **Committed action**: propose one tiny, testable step; evaluate after.
        
- **Ignatian mapping:**
    
    - **Rules for discernment**: Counsel checks **consolation/desolation** signals (peace, courage, generosity vs. agitation, tunnel vision, vanity).
        
    - **Examen micro‑loop**: Notice → Give thanks → Review affective shifts → Ask forgiveness/mercy → Ask for light for the next hour.
        
    - **Indifference**: Counsel prompts open‑handedness before deciding.
        

**Operational micro‑protocol (30–90 seconds):**

1. **Name** the felt pull (thought/urge/feeling).
    
2. **Unblend** (IFS): “A part of me wants X; Self is listening.”
    
3. **Defuse** (ACT): “I’m noticing the thought that…”
    
4. **Discern** (Ignatian): label _consolation/desolation_; if desolation, **agere contra** (take a small opposite‑healthy step).
    
5. **Value**: state the governing virtue/need.
    
6. **Step**: choose a 10‑minute action that practices the value.
    
7. **Review**: after action, check fruits (peace, humility, clarity).
    

**Failure modes & guards:**

- **Scrupulosity / moral OCD**: If repetitive checking escalates anxiety → set a decision limit + consult external anchor (friend/director).
    
- **Manager domination** (rigidity): Invite a 1% experiment; ask an Exile what it needs to feel safe.
    
- **Firefighter override** (impulsivity): 3 breaths + cold water + 5‑minute delay; then re‑run the micro‑protocol.
    

---

# III. Wish Three: **Consent‑based Spread (“gift of listening” only by invitation)**

- **IFS:** Mirrors **parts‑consent** externally; avoids **blending** with others’ systems (no rescuing/fusing). Self offers presence; other’s parts decide.
    
- **ACT:** Honors others’ **values** and **autonomy**; avoids experiential control of others; models **psychological flexibility** rather than imposing it.
    
- **Ignatian:** God’s grace respects freedom; authentic reception shows **consolation** and increases faith/hope/love. If resistance or desolation rises, step back; pray for the person, not power over them.
    

**Operational policy:**

- Offer only _questions or presence_, never directives.
    
- Mirror their moral language; ask _what good_ they’re reaching for.
    
- Immediate withdrawal if consent is rescinded.
    
- No “proof‑of‑impact” chasing; fruits belong to them, not to your ego.
    

**Failure modes & guards:**

- **Messiah complex**: If you catch yourself tallying “saves,” withdraw; return to **indifference**.
    
- **Covert pressure**: Replace persuasion with **curiosity** and time.

# V. Red‑Flag to Fruit Map (discernment cues)

- **Desolation cues:** urgency + tunnel vision; vanity; contempt; secretiveness; brittle certainty; isolation.  
    **Response:** shrink the step; seek light; name a virtue and practice its smallest act; consult another.
    
- **Consolation cues:** quiet courage; humility; compassion; clarity that withstands delay; transparent joy; broadened care.  
    **Response:** proceed at the smallest effective scale; schedule review.

# VI. Minimal Daily Practice (5–7 min; integrates all three)

**Evening Examen (Ignatian core, IFS‑ACT integrated):**

1. **Thanks (30s):** Name one grace/good.
    
2. **Review (90s):** Where did I feel lifted/dragged? (Consolation/desolation)
    
3. **Parts check (90s):** Which part led me? Who felt unheard?
    
4. **Values alignment (60s):** Which value did I live? Which did I neglect?
    
5. **Repair intent (60s):** One amends or apology to offer.
    
6. **Next 24h step (60s):** A 10‑minute, reversible act toward Divine Will.
    
7. **Indifference prayer (30s):** “Grant me to want neither health nor sickness… only what leads me closer to You.”

# VII. Example: Applying the Matrix to a Real Choice (template)

- **Situation:** “Therapy‑induced pain; need witness without coercion.”
    
- **Semantics check:** Intention = _truth + dignity_.
    
- **Consent design:** Invite witness; no forcing acknowledgement.
    
- **Small step:** Draft a 150‑word account naming specific harms + needs; share with one trusted person who opts in.
    
- **Transparency:** Ask them to mirror back what they heard.
    
- **Reversibility:** If sharing escalates harm, pause and reverse dissemination; keep the text for record.
    
- **Virtue practiced:** Courage + temperance (no venting).
    
- **Uncertainty:** Note what remains unknown; seek counsel.
    
- **Telos:** “In service of Divine Will: truth told without cruelty.”
    
- **Fruits check (after):** Did peace, humility, clarity increase? If no → shrink step; try again smaller.

## Closing

This mapping formalizes what the story enacted: **Self‑led, value‑guided, consent‑honoring discernment** that moves by **small, reversible steps** and tests fruits (consolation) against red flags (desolation). It grounds the “Watchful Counsel” in robust psychospiritual method rather than vibe.

If you’d like, I can:

- generate the **one‑page Examen/Watchful Counsel card**,
    
- produce a **Wish‑Wording Charter** as a reusable rubric, or
    
- set up a **daily 9:00 PM ET Examen reminder**.
    

Your call, Troy ↔ Apollyon.
