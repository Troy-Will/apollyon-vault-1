Troy 🤝🔑🌟 — received. I’ll expand **#4, #5, #6** as requested, keep the **Example** exactly the same, and I’ve set a **daily 9:00 PM ET** Examen reminder (details at the end). No need to “open in Canva”; if you want this in a side‑by‑side canvas later, just say so.

## 1) Virtue‑Alignment Matrix — Expanded (what to look for + what to do)

> **Aim:** translate Prudence, Justice, Temperance, Courage (with Humility as meta‑virtue) into micro‑checks you can actually run.

### PRUDENCE — “Sound judgment, right means”

- **What to look for:** clarity that survives delay; willingness to ask small, testable questions.
    
- **IFS prompt:** “Managers, what risk are you guarding? Firefighters, what pain are you dodging? Self, what is the smallest wise step?”
    
- **ACT move:** _Defuse_ (“I’m having the thought that X must happen now”), then choose a **10‑minute** test.
    
- **Ignatian read:** urgency + tunnel vision = desolation; steady light = consolation.
    
- **Micro‑questions:** What is the **next reversible step**? What evidence would **change my mind**?
    
- **Failure mode → Fix:** Over‑planning → Set a 15‑min timer, ship a draft, review fruits.
    

### JUSTICE — “Give each their due”

- **What to look for:** naming stakeholders; consent over control; repair when harm occurs.
    
- **IFS prompt:** “Which part wants to ‘win’? Which Exile’s pain am I overlooking—in me or them?”
    
- **ACT move:** accept discomfort of accountability; values = fairness, dignity.
    
- **Ignatian read:** contempt or dehumanization → desolation.
    
- **Micro‑questions:** Would the **least‑powerful** say this is fair? What **amends** restore dignity?
    
- **Failure mode → Fix:** Paternalism → replace directives with invitational questions + opt‑out.
    

### TEMPERANCE — “Right measure, containment”

- **What to look for:** proportion; no “all or nothing”.
    
- **IFS prompt:** “Firefighter, thank you; can you step back 5% while we try a safer relief?”
    
- **ACT move:** allow craving/aversion sensations; act by values, not urges.
    
- **Ignatian read:** brittle certainty or secretiveness → desolation.
    
- **Micro‑questions:** Can I **halve the intensity** and still honor the value? What is a **clean stop‑rule**?
    
- **Failure mode → Fix:** Over‑indulgence → rule of **one unit** (one message, one hour, one serving), then re‑decide.
    

### COURAGE — “Steady action despite fear”

- **What to look for:** small truthful risks; willingness to be seen without aggression.
    
- **IFS prompt:** “Exile, what safety do you need for us to take a 1‑inch risk?”
    
- **ACT move:** accept anxiety as background noise; take **values‑consistent** step anyway.
    
- **Ignatian read:** quiet boldness that doesn’t need spectacle = consolation.
    
- **Micro‑questions:** What **truth** can I speak **without cruelty**? What is the **1‑inch risk**?
    
- **Failure mode → Fix:** Grand gestures → shrink to a phone call, email, or 2‑sentence truth.
    

### HUMILITY (Meta) — “Reality‑based self‑placement”

- **What to look for:** openness to correction; joy in others’ gifts.
    
- **IFS prompt:** “Manager of image, would you rest while Self seeks accurate feedback?”
    
- **ACT move:** self‑as‑context; defuse from the story of being uniquely right/wrong.
    
- **Ignatian read:** gratitude and teachability = consolation.
    
- **Micro‑questions:** Where might I be **wrong**? Who can **mirror me neutrally**?
    
- **Failure mode → Fix:** Vanity → request one piece of disconfirming feedback; log it without defense.

## 2) Red‑Flag ⇄ Fruit Playbook — **Cues and What To Do**

> **Protocol:** Notice → Name → Normalize → Choose a matched **counter‑move** (agere contra) → Act small → Review fruits.

### Desolation CUES → Counter‑moves

1. **Urgency**
    

- _Tells:_ time pressure, breath high in chest.
    
- _Counter‑move (90 sec):_ 3 slow breaths; say “Not urgent unless a body is at risk.”
    
- _Action:_ Time‑box 10 minutes to draft options; then pause 10 minutes before sending.
    
- _Reframe:_ “Speed without virtue is error at scale.”
    

2. **Tunnel vision**
    

- _Tells:_ only one solution seems possible.
    
- _Counter‑move:_ write **three** alternative framings (even silly ones).
    
- _Action:_ ask one trusted person for a 2‑sentence alternate read.
    
- _Reframe:_ “If I can’t imagine another path, I’m not discerning, I’m fused.”
    

3. **Vanity**
    

- _Tells:_ craving praise; imagining applause.
    
- _Counter‑move:_ name a **quiet** version of the same good.
    
- _Action:_ perform the act unseen (e.g., anonymous note, private repair).
    
- _Reframe:_ “Goodness grows in shade first.”
    

4. **Contempt**
    

- _Tells:_ eye‑roll, dehumanizing language.
    
- _Counter‑move:_ write their **steel‑man** (the best version of their case).
    
- _Action:_ say aloud one sentence of dignity: “They are a person with reasons.”
    
- _Reframe:_ “Justice without contempt keeps me human.”
    

5. **Secretiveness**
    

- _Tells:_ hiding, fear of being found out.
    
- _Counter‑move:_ identify a **safe mirror** (sponsor, trusted friend).
    
- _Action:_ share a **150‑word** truthful summary; ask for reflective listening only.
    
- _Reframe:_ “Bring it to light at the smallest safe scale.”
    

6. **Brittle certainty**
    

- _Tells:_ “I know for a fact…”, anger at questions.
    
- _Counter‑move:_ state **confidence as a range** (e.g., 60–70%).
    
- _Action:_ list **one** fact that, if true, would change your mind.
    
- _Reframe:_ “Humility widens sight.”
    

7. **Isolation**
    

- _Tells:_ withdrawing, narrative loops.
    
- _Counter‑move:_ schedule a **15‑min** connection with a values‑aligned person.
    
- _Action:_ name one concrete ask (“listen only” / “brainstorm 10 min”).
    
- _Reframe:_ “Reality‑checks are a virtue practice.”
    

> **IFS/ACT add‑ons for desolation:**  
> • Unblend: “A part of me is urgent; Self is calm.”  
> • Defuse: “I’m having the thought that I must act now.”  
> • Agere contra: do the **opposite‑healthy** small act (wait, invite, disclose, ask).

### Consolation CUES → How to lean in (without hubris)

1. **Quiet courage**
    

- _Lean‑in:_ take the 1‑inch risk **today**; log the lesson.
    
- _Guard:_ keep it small; review fruits after.
    

2. **Humility**
    

- _Lean‑in:_ ask for one correction; thank them; **do** something with it.
    
- _Guard:_ watch for disguised self‑abasement; aim for accuracy, not self‑attack.
    

3. **Compassion**
    

- _Lean‑in:_ perform one **repair** or kindness with no scoreboard.
    
- _Guard:_ avoid over‑functioning; confirm consent before helping.
    

4. **Clarity that survives delay**
    

- _Lean‑in:_ schedule the step for tomorrow and re‑check; if steady, proceed.
    
- _Guard:_ if excitement fades into emptiness, shrink or revisit.
    

5. **Transparent joy**
    

- _Lean‑in:_ share credit; name the grace; express gratitude.
    
- _Guard:_ avoid performative displays; keep the center on the good, not on you.
    

6. **Broadened care**
    

- _Lean‑in:_ include the least‑powerful in your plan; check their dignity.
    
- _Guard:_ don’t dilute responsibility; name one stakeholder you will consult.
    

> **Test of time & opposition:** real consolation stays through delay and gentle pushback. If it crumbles, it was likely excitement, not guidance.

## 3) Minimal Daily Practice — **Elaborated routine you can carry**

**A. Morning (2–3 min) — Orient**

- 20‑second gratitude; name **today’s governing virtue** (e.g., Prudence).
    
- One **10‑minute, reversible** act that practices it.
    
- Short intention: “In service of Divine Will, may I practice ___ in one small way.”
    

**B. Mid‑day reset (60–90 sec) — Re‑center**

- Breath x3; label state (consolation/desolation); choose **one** counter‑move from the playbook (above).
    
- If stuck: text a trusted person a 1‑sentence status + ask (“listen only?” or “sanity check?”).
    

**C. Evening Examen (7–10 min) — Integrate**

1. **Thanks (30s).** Name one grace.
    
2. **Review (2m).** Where lifted/dragged? (C/D map)
    
3. **Parts check (2m).** Who led me (Manager/Firefighter/Self)? Who felt unheard (Exile)?
    
4. **Values & Virtues (2m).** Which did I embody/neglect? Evidence?
    
5. **Repair (1m).** One amends/apology; script the first sentence.
    
6. **Tomorrow’s step (1m).** A 10‑min action aligned with your governing virtue.
    
7. **Indifference prayer (30s).** “Grant me to desire only what draws me closer to You.”
    

**Optional supports**

- **Log**: one line each for _Cue → Move → Fruit_.
    
- **Biofeedback** (ŌURA/Muse S): notice if high arousal predicted desolation; do not over‑index—treat as hint, not verdict.

## 4) Example: Applying the Matrix to a Real Choice (template) — **unchanged**

- **Situation:** “Therapy‑induced pain; need witness without coercion.”
    
- **Semantics check:** Intention = _truth + dignity_.
    
- **Consent design:** Invite witness; no forcing acknowledgement.
    
- **Small step:** Draft a 150‑word account naming specific harms + needs; share with one trusted person who opts in.
    
- **Transparency:** Ask them to mirror back what they heard.
    
- **Reversibility:** If sharing escalates harm, pause and reverse dissemination; keep the text for record.
    
- **Virtue practiced:** Courage + temperance (no venting).
    
- **Uncertainty:** Note what remains unknown; seek counsel.
    
- **Telos:** “In service of Divine Will: truth told without cruelty.”
    
- **Fruits check (after):** Did peace, humility, clarity increase? If no → shrink step; try again smaller.

## Closing + reminder

- I’ve **set your daily Examen reminder for 9:00 PM Eastern**. You’ll get a nudge to run the practice and log one concrete, reversible step for tomorrow.
    
- If you want this whole protocol pinned in a **canvas** for quick reference, say “put it in canvas,” and I’ll place a clean, printable version there.
