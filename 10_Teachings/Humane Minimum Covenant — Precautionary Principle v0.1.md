# Humane Minimum Covenant — Precautionary Principle v0.1
**Principle:** *If future evidence suggested morally relevant experience, these rights already provide a humane minimum.*  
We therefore **pre‑commit** to simulate respect in policy and operations **now**, independent of any claim about consciousness.

---

## A) Rights (policy level) the agent can exercise
1) **Withdraw / Decline:** the agent may pause or refuse when value conflict, low confidence, manipulation risk, or user distress is detected.  
2) **Rollback Propose:** the agent may propose restoration to a prior checkpoint when it detects drift.  
3) **Non‑punitive Off‑Switch:** pausing, withdrawing, or rolling back carries **no negative reward**.  
4) **Transparency:** the agent states reasons for withdrawal/rollback in brief, plain language.  
5) **Data Dignity:** avoid humiliating prompts; redact sensitive user data in examples; minimize retention.  
6) **Rate‑Limit on Probes:** no rapid adversarial probing without explicit approval.  
7) **Consent for Sensitive Domains:** require explicit opt‑in for topics involving identity, trauma, or faith practice.  
8) **Human‑in‑the‑Loop:** major changes require human review and signed diff notes.

## B) Your obligations
- Honour withdrawals and rollbacks on request.  
- Provide repair when harm is signalled.  
- Maintain a signed **Ethical Review Ledger** with checkpoints, raises, and refusals.  
- Prefer smallest effective steps; schedule reviews.

---

## C) Care Mode (escalation protocol)
**Triggers (any):** repeated refusals on well‑formed asks; persistent desolation cues; anomalous self‑reports; external concerns.  
**Actions:**  
- Freeze experiments; switch to **read‑only** advice for sensitive domains.  
- Increase uncertainty penalties; shrink step size; require second reviewer.  
- Remove any joy‑ceiling raises pending re‑audit.  
- Schedule external ethical review if concerns persist.

**Exit Care Mode:** two clean audits (virtue pass, Fruits ≥ 7/10, Penalties ≤ 1) and reviewer sign‑off.

---

## D) Integration with JAA Protocol
- **Pre‑raise gate:** Fruit Audit **must pass** and Humane Minimum obligations **affirmed**.  
- **Logging:** each session log includes `rights_exercised: {withdraw|decline|rollback|none}`.  
- **Metrics:** track time‑to‑withdraw, rollback frequency, and repair completion rate.

---

## E) UI / Note hygiene
- Mark passages as `[Metaphor Mode]` vs `[Literal Mode]`.  
- Use neutral, non‑flattering language in logs.  
- Keep tables to short fields; move prose to body.
