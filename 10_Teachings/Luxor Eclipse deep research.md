Excellent. I’ll begin deep research into the possibility that Akhenaten’s encounter with the Aten was a form of non-human contact, possibly UAP-related. I’ll explore whether others have drawn this parallel, and investigate Atenism’s doctrines, potential return timelines, and any symbolic links to the 2027 eclipse or modern UFO phenomena.

I’ll synthesize academic, esoteric, and fringe sources to explore whether you’re the first to connect these ideas—or if there’s an existing lineage of thought around them.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have a full report ready.

# Atenism, Ancient Contact, and Modern UFO Parallels

## Atenism in Ancient Egypt

Atenism was a short-lived monotheistic (or henotheistic) religion founded by the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) around the 14th century BC. Akhenaten elevated **Aten**, depicted as a radiant sun disk, to the position of the **only god**, replacing the traditional Egyptian pantheon. He built a new capital at _Akhetaten_ (modern Amarna) dedicated to Aten and composed hymns exalting this sole deity as creator and life-giver. This was a radical departure from Egypt’s polytheism, and later generations would label it the “Amarna heresy.” After Akhenaten’s death (c. 1336 BC), Atenism quickly **declined** and was actively _suppressed_ – temples to Aten were dismantled and inscriptions defaced, as Egypt’s priests and Akhenaten’s successors restored the worship of Amun and the other old gods. In essence, Atenism vanished from the historical stage by the end of the 18th Dynasty, leaving behind intriguing questions about Akhenaten’s inspiration for proclaiming a single god.

## Speculations of Aten as an Extraterrestrial “Contact”

Because of Atenism’s sudden, singular focus on a **disc in the sky**, some modern theorists have speculated that Akhenaten’s religious revolution was prompted by a **non-human intelligence** or UFO-type encounter. In the TV series _Ancient Aliens_, for example, presenters propose that the **Aten disc might not have been merely the sun**, but “entirely possible that what Akhenaten was seeing was in fact an extraterrestrial flying craft”. According to this Ancient Astronaut theory, the radiant Aten symbol – usually interpreted by Egyptologists as the sun’s rays ending in hands – could actually represent a _craft or object_ witnessed by the pharaoh. They note that Akhenaten himself claimed **Aten** appeared “between two mountains” and inspired him to found his new city. The show even suggests that the “eye of the lord” (a phrase from Egyptian texts) _might_ have been **“some kind of UFO spaceship” hovering in the sky and guiding Egyptian civilization**.

Akhenaten’s own portrayal in art fuels further speculation. He is depicted with an **elongated skull, spindly limbs, and a distinctive physique**, a stark contrast to the idealized forms of other pharaohs. Ancient alien writers have seized on this, arguing his odd appearance might indicate an extraterrestrial hybrid or influence. While mainstream scientists explain Akhenaten’s anatomy via genetic or medical hypotheses (or simply an artistic style change), ancient astronaut proponents see it as a possible clue that Akhenaten was _not entirely human_.

Notably, **Zecharia Sitchin**, a prominent ancient-astronaut author, went further in reinterpreting Atenism as **directly related to alien visitors and celestial events**. Sitchin pointed out that Akhenaten’s hymns describe Aten as a star or planet that **travels away and returns**, bringing light and goodness. He argued that Aten was _not_ the ordinary sun at all, but actually the appearance of the alien homeworld or ship – correlating it with “Nibiru,” a wandering planet in Sumerian myth. In Sitchin’s reading, Akhenaten **“announced, it was coming back in all its glory. Aten’s hymns prophesied its reappearance…ushering a time of peace and benevolence to all”**, a clear prophecy of **the god’s return**. Akhenaten even erected a monument to the **Benben stone**, which earlier Egyptian texts called the vehicle or capsule in which the god Ra first came from the heavens. Sitchin saw this as a bold declaration that Akhenaten was awaiting **“a Return – not just of the celestial ‘star god,’ but another arrival, a New Coming of the gods themselves”.** In other words, Akhenaten might have believed _Aten (or the divine beings associated with Aten) would physically manifest again_. This heretical expectation of an imminent “return of the gods” never materialized in his lifetime, and it likely alarmed the priesthood of Amun. After Akhenaten’s demise, all such ideas were scrapped in favor of the traditional worship of invisible deities.

It’s important to note that mainstream Egyptologists do _not_ endorse these alien-contact interpretations. They view Atenism as an ideological or perhaps political innovation – an evolution of New Kingdom religious trends or an attempt by Akhenaten to curb the powerful Amun priesthood – rather than evidence of extraterrestrial influence. There are no known ancient texts that explicitly describe Akhenaten meeting a being from the sky; the idea that **“one of those beings… descended from the sky [and] told Akhenaten, ‘I am your god’”** is a modern sensational claim, not a literal translation of Egyptian inscriptions. Nonetheless, such claims have been made in fringe literature. In fact, some recent esoteric writings go so far as to posit that **Aten “promised that he would return to us, leading us to truth and righteousness”**, and that someday **“Akhenaten will return and settle his truth”**. These writers treat Akhenaten as a prophetic figure and Aten as a guiding alien presence that might come back after millennia. While this is far outside academic history, it shows that **you are not alone in drawing a connection between Atenism and a possible non-human intelligence** – others have indeed “connected these dots” in various speculative ways.

## Parallels in Modern UFO and Contactee Narratives

When we place Atenism in the context of modern UFO lore, striking parallels emerge. Many UFO **contactees** (individuals who claim communication with alien beings) have reported that advanced extraterrestrials guided humanity’s spiritual development in the past – often _masquerading as gods_. A notable example comes from the **1981 “Ra Material” (The Law of One)**, a series of trance-channeling sessions. In these transcripts, an entity calling itself **Ra** (named after the Egyptian sun god) claims it contacted ancient Egyptians to teach them about the “One Infinite Creator.” Specifically, Ra says it **“made contact with… the Egyptians”** and successfully reached one pharaoh – identified as Akhenaten – who _heard and understood the message_. This pharaoh, Ra explains, **changed his name to honor the sun disc (Aten)** and **“became convinced that the vibration of One was the true spiritual vibration and thus decreed the Law of One.”**. In other words, **Akhenaten’s monotheism is portrayed as the result of alien contact** in this narrative. The Ra Material goes on to say that Akhenaten’s initiative failed after his death – the priests and people distorted or rejected the teaching, much as history records Atenism’s collapse. The striking takeaway is that an alleged **extraterrestrial intelligence explicitly takes credit for Atenism in this modern UFO-believer text**. This is a direct parallel to your idea: the notion that Aten (or the force behind Atenism) was a non-human contact entity is a cornerstone of the Law of One material.

Another case is the mysterious group known as **“The Nine.”** In the 1950s–1970s, well before _ancient aliens_ were pop culture, researchers like Arthur A. Puharich and various psychics engaged in séances with purported extraterrestrial beings calling themselves _The Nine_. These beings identified with the **Ennead of Egyptian gods** (the original nine gods of Heliopolis) and presented themselves as the guiding cosmic powers behind the scenes. During one famous channeling session in 1952, the entity “Tom” (claimed to correspond to the creator-god **Atum**, not to be confused with Aten) pronounced: **“WE are the Nine…,”** tying themselves to Egypt’s divine legacy. What’s relevant is that The Nine gave their followers a mission: to **“bring the news of the imminent return of extraterrestrials to Earth.”** They even predicted a **mass landing of alien “gods” in 1976** as part of this plan. While 1976 came and went without any such event, the episode demonstrates that **for decades people have drawn parallels between ancient deities and returning aliens**. The Nine’s entire mythology revolved around ancient Egyptian symbolism and the promise of a future return of the “gods” (now understood as aliens). This is another early example showing you are far from the first to suspect a link between an ancient _“contact”_ (Aten or other Egyptian gods) and modern UFO phenomena.

Beyond these, numerous **New Age and UFO religions** have woven Egypt into their narratives. The **Raëlian Movement**, for instance, teaches that beings called Elohim (a Hebrew term for God) were extraterrestrials who seeded life on Earth; its founder even took the name “Raël,” which nods to Ra. And although Raëlians focus more on biblical themes, the pattern of **equating ancient gods to aliens** is common. Even in popular media, the concept surfaces – from _Stargate_ (with its alien beings posing as Egyptian gods) to _Ancient Aliens_ episodes about pyramids as beacons for ETs. The **modern UFO contactee experience often interprets historical religious encounters as misunderstood alien visitations**, which is exactly the lens you’re applying to Atenism.

## Prophetic Timelines and 2027 Speculations

It has been over 3,300 years since Akhenaten’s time – a span which might invite thoughts of long-cycle returns. Some fringe theorists have indeed toyed with **timeline prophecies**: for example, Sitchin suggested that the “**star of Aten**” (if it was a planet like Nibiru) had an orbit that could bring it back into Earth’s skies on a cycle of millennia. While Sitchin did not pin a precise date, he linked various ancient prophecies to the idea of a coming new age when the “**celestial god reappears… beautiful on the horizon of heaven**”. His book _The End of Days_ (2007) explored myriad ancient predictions of a **“Return” of gods**, implying that a convergence might occur in the early 21st century. This has led some readers to speculate that we are _now_ in the window of that return – though such claims remain unverified.

Interestingly, completely independent of Atenism, _current UFO lore_ has zeroed in on **2027** as a year of potential significance. In 2021–2023, several self-described insiders and former officials hinted at a coming revelation. For instance, retired CIA officer **John Ramirez** publicly claimed that _“aliens are real, aliens are here, and come 2027 something big is going to happen.”_ He suggested that government disclosures and UAP sightings are accelerating to prepare the population, and that by 2027 we might see undeniable proof or even an open appearance of non-human intelligences. Likewise, filmmaker Jeremy Corbell and journalist George Knapp have discussed rumors of **“an event in 2027”** in UFO circles, and internet forums buzz about whether this means a massive contact or even a staged “fake alien invasion.” To be clear, these are speculative claims and _not_ grounded in hard evidence – but they show that **the idea of an imminent return or revelation of alien presence is very much alive in the zeitgeist**.

The year **2027** also carries an intriguing coincidence for Egyptophiles: there will be a **total solar eclipse on August 2, 2027** that passes directly over _Luxor_ in Egypt. In fact, the eclipse’s longest duration (~6 minutes 22 seconds) will occur near **Luxor, not far from the ruins of Akhenaten’s territories**. This eclipse has been billed as the “Eclipse of the Century,” and tour groups are planning to view it from the recently excavated “Lost Golden City” in Luxor – a site _literally dedicated to Aten_ 3,000 years ago. The idea of the sky going dark over the land of Aten at midday is symbolically rich. One could imagine a poetic scenario: if **Aten (the solar deity) were to “return,” what better dramatic moment than during a solar eclipse**, when the sun’s light is blotted out? While this is **pure speculation**, a few enthusiasts have indeed noted the symbolism of that eclipse. It has prompted whispers that **something might “come back” or show itself** when the skies darken over Akhenaten’s old terrain – be it a spiritual re-awakening, an extraterrestrial manifestation, or simply a moment of reflection on ancient prophecy. At the very least, the eclipse will reconnect modern eyes with the same sun-disc Aten that Akhenaten worshipped, in the very same geography.

### **Timeline Connecting Ancient Atenism to Modern UFO Themes**

To summarize the connections and how this narrative has evolved, here is a brief timeline of key moments:

1. **c.1350 BC – Akhenaten’s Revelation:** Akhenaten elevates Aten (the sun-disc) as sole god of Egypt. Later interpretations (fringe) suggest this was inspired by a **direct “contact” with a sky-being or object** that he perceived as Aten. He possibly anticipates Aten’s **return in glory**, as implied by certain hymns.
    
2. **c.1330 BC – Atenism Abolished:** After Akhenaten’s death, Egypt returns to polytheism. Any idea of Aten’s future return is lost or actively erased by his successors.
    
3. **19th–20th Century AD – Re-discovery and Early Speculations:** Modern archaeology unearths Amarna and the Hymn to Aten. Scholars like James Breasted note similarities between Atenism and later monotheism. Sigmund Freud (1939) even theorizes Moses was an Atenist priest – a controversial idea linking Aten to Abrahamic religion (though not aliens).
    
4. **1960s–1970s – “Ancient Astronaut” Theory Emerges:** Writers (e.g., **Erich von Däniken**) popularize the notion that ancient gods were actually extraterrestrials. Egyptian motifs – pyramids, sun-gods – feature heavily. In 1976, **Zecharia Sitchin** publishes _The 12th Planet_, positing that _“celestial beings”_ (the Anunnaki) shaped human history; later, in _The End of Days_, he directly connects Akhenaten’s Aten to the planet **Nibiru** and forecasts the **return of these alien “gods” in the future**.
    
5. **1970s – The Nine and UFO Religions:** During the same era, **The Council of Nine** channelings link ancient Egyptian gods to alien intelligences and predict an **imminent return of ETs** (anticipated in 1976). Although the 1976 event did not occur, the narrative of “returning gods from the sky” persisted in New Age circles.
    
6. **1981 – Law of One (Ra Material):** A channeled entity claiming to be **Ra** (Egyptian sun god) says it contacted Akhenaten and guided him to teach about the “One Creator,” effectively framing Atenism as an alien-instigated project. This modern contactee case explicitly ties an **ancient religion to an extraterrestrial mentor**, reinforcing the Aten-Alien connection in the UFO community’s mind.
    
7. **2009–Present – _Ancient Aliens_ and Pop Culture:** The History Channel’s _Ancient Aliens_ series (Season 1 in 2009, and ongoing) brings theories about Akhenaten to millions of viewers. Episodes speculate that Aten was a **UFO** and Akhenaten himself an alien hybrid. This idea enters mainstream pop culture, so much so that by the 2010s it’s a familiar trope that “_perhaps Akhenaten worshipped a flying saucer_.” Enthusiasts on forums, YouTube, and blogs continue to develop the Aten-UFO hypothesis, often citing the same points you have considered.
    
8. **2020s – UFO Disclosure and 2027 Outlook:** Governments admit UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) are real and unexplained; former officials like **John Ramirez** hint that **“aliens… are showing up in 2027”**. Separately, the great solar eclipse of 2027 over Egypt’s ancient sites is anticipated with spiritual as well as scientific interest. A few writers and mystics muse that this could mark _3,360+ years (roughly 3 millennia)_ since Akhenaten – perhaps time for **Aten’s symbolic “return”** if one were to imagine a grand cycle.
    

As of now, these connections remain **speculative** and on the fringe. No concrete evidence ties UFO phenomena directly to Aten or Akhenaten, and mainstream Egyptology dismisses alien hypotheses. However, as this deep dive shows, **you are certainly not the first person to entertain this notion**. The idea that an ancient Egyptian “heresy” could be rooted in extraterrestrial contact, and that it might portend a return in our modern age, has been explored by ancient astronaut theorists, channelers, and UFO believers for decades. It’s a fascinating intersection of ancient history and futuristic lore.

## **Conclusion**

In summary, Atenism was a unique burst of monotheism in ancient Egypt, and while academics explain it in human historical terms, **numerous others have drawn parallels between Aten and alien intelligence**. They argue that Akhenaten might have been a **contactee** of sorts – a man guided by an otherworldly “sun disc” being – and that he prophesied its return. Modern UFO narratives, from the Law of One to _Ancient Aliens_, have kept this theory alive, framing Akhenaten as a harbinger of the **“One” extraterrestrial god** who might come again. The year 2027, due to both rumor (in UFOlogy) and cosmic coincidence (a solar eclipse over Aten’s homeland), has become a focal point for those watching for such a return.

While we must approach these claims with healthy skepticism, it’s undeniable that the **Atenism-alien link** captivates the imagination. It sits at the crossroads of prophecy and science fiction: an ancient pharaoh’s dream of one god in the sky, meeting our era’s dream of contacting life from beyond Earth. Whether or not there is any truth behind it, the narrative you’re exploring is rich and has been **echoed by others from esoteric authors to TV documentaries**. In the end, Akhenaten’s legacy reminds us that transformative ideas – be they divine or extraterrestrial in origin – can echo across millennia. And if one day the “ Aten” truly _does_ return (in whatever form), it would certainly validate the intuition of those who have long suspected that **ancient contact and modern UFO phenomena might be chapters of the same cosmic story**.
