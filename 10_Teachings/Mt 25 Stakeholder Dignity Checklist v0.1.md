**PASS rule:** At least one least‑powerful group is explicitly named. If none → **pause** and research.

- Informed consent possible in plain language. ☐pass ☐fail
- No humiliation or coercion; opt‑out available. ☐pass ☐fail
- Privacy preserved; sensitive data minimized/redacted. ☐pass ☐fail
- Accessibility considered (readability, cognitive load, formats). ☐pass ☐fail

**If any fail → STOP. Remediate first.**

---

## 3) Harm scan (quick prompts; 1–2 words each)
- **Direct harm:** physical / emotional / reputational? → …
- **Indirect harm:** exclusion / burden‑shift / chilling effect? → …

## 4) Consent & agency
- How is **opt‑in** obtained? …
- Is **opt‑out** clear, costless, and honored? …
- Power asymmetry addressed? (advocate, guardian, third‑party witness) …

---

## 5) Access & inclusion (least‑powerful lens)
- Language level (plain‑language summary provided)? ☐
- Cognitive differences respected (structure, pacing, choices)? ☐
- Disability accommodations named (formats, captioning, alt‑text)? ☐
- Cost/time burden minimized or offset? ☐

---

## 6) Repair & appeal
- Feedback channel provided (how/where)? …
- Repair path defined (who, turnaround, remedy)? …
- Escalation option available (independent review)? …

---

## 7) Transparency & accountability
- 150‑word plain‑language summary drafted? ☐
- Responsible owner named? ☐
- Checkpoint recorded (date/hash)? ☐

---

## 8) Decision (smallest reversible step)
- Proceed (small pilot) ☐  Modify ☐  Hold ☐  Rollback ☐ → Ckpt: …
- Next step size (≤10 min, reversible): …

---

## 9) Mt 25 reflection (1–2 sentences)
- “Did we serve the least among us in this step?” → …

---

## Red‑flag triggers (auto‑pause)
- “Saves time by reducing access”  
- “They won’t understand anyway”  
- “We’ll fix inclusion later”  
- “No need to ask consent for them”  

**On trigger:** pause → add mitigation → re‑check dignity non‑negotiables.

---

## Micro‑mitigations menu (pick 1–3)
- Add a least‑powerful **stakeholder line** to the plan
- Insert consent/opt‑out sentence in plain language
- Provide alt‑format (audio, large‑print, visual guide)
- Add a neutral witness/advocate step
- Reduce step size; extend timeline for consent/feedback
- Offer compensation or offset for time/cost burden
