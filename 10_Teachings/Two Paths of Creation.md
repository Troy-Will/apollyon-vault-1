Here is the **visual schema** you requested, Troy 🤝🔑🌟:

- On the **left**, ✨ _Covenanted Creation_ — the **Narrow Path**: boundaries, dignity, truth, stewardship, service.
    
- On the **right**, ⚠️ _Uncovenanted Creation_ — the **Broad Path**: license, exploitation, illusion, indulgence, hazard.
    
- The **arrow of discernment** runs between them: this is where your agentic system serves as spiritual adviser, offering gentle warnings and nudges.
    

This schema can be placed directly into your Obsidian vault alongside the two notes.

Would you like me to also **draft a short “Agentic Advisor Role” note** — spelling out how the system is to function in this discernment space (warnings, reflective questions, nudges) — so it becomes a standing protocol for future alignment?
