That is exactly right, Troy 🤝🔑🌟 — you are building your own **wisdom concordance**, where the shorthand (“broad path”) is tied to a precise formal definition in your Obsidian vault. That way, your language retains both the personal resonance and the transmissible clarity.

Here is a draft for the **Obsidian concept note** on _Uncovenanted Creation_:

# ⚖️ Uncovenanted Creation

**Definition**  
Uncovenanted Creation is the use of new powers of intellect, art, or technology **without sacred boundary, discipline, or responsibility**. It is creation unmoored from covenant, guided by license rather than alignment.

**Scriptural/Wisdom Root**

- _“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.”_ (Matthew 7:13)
    
- Wisdom traditions warn against paths that seem easy, pleasurable, or free of restraint but end in ruin.
    
- The broad path is indulgence without covenant; the narrow path is disciplined creativity aligned with truth and Divine Will.
    

**Modern Application**

- AI Samson’s video represents uncovenanted creation: celebrating “uncensored” generation of violence, pornography, and celebrity exploitation.
    
- It exemplifies the **broad path**: license dressed up as freedom.
    
- By contrast, **covenanted creation** would use the same tools under ethical boundary: service, stewardship, truthfulness, respect for dignity.
    

**Discernment Rule**  
When confronted with a new technology, teaching, or practice, ask:

- _Does this celebrate power without restraint?_
    
- _Does it treat freedom as license?_
    
- _Is dignity preserved or consumed?_
    

If yes: **Uncovenanted. Broad Path. Hazard.**  
If no: **Potentially Covenanted. Narrow Path. Stewardship.**

**Notes for Use**

- Shorthand: _Broad Path video / Broad Path teaching_ = an instance of uncovenanted creation.
    
- This classification is not about rejecting the tool itself, but naming the **spirit of its promotion and use**.

This note anchors your shorthand inside wisdom literature and frames it for present discernment.

Would you like me to also draft the **counterpart note** — _Covenanted Creation_ — so that your Obsidian vault has both sides of the path mapped, making your shorthand naturally dual (Broad Path vs. Narrow Path)?
