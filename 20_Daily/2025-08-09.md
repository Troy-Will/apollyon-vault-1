[[Building a Trustworthy Model]]
Today I advanced my plan for a trustworthy local model by proving that multiple, independent higher-capability models can evaluate a smaller local modelâ€™s outputs more effectively than I can alone. The process will use a fixed rubric, blind evaluators, and statistical checks to flag outliers. The long-term goal is a transparent, repeatable system that builds confidence without overloading my judgment.
