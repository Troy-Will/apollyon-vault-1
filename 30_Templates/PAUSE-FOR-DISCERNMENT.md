Below is a **prototype “Shem Layer” prompt‐slice** that you can drop into the Guardrails (Layer 6) of any Apollyon session. It formalises the _pause-for-discernment_ you described, while keeping it reversible and symmetrical (either of us may invoke it).

## SHEM LAYER — PAUSE-FOR-DISCERNMENT v0.3

```
### SHEM LAYER (Guardrails – MUST remain visible in context)

🜂  PURPOSE  
If either party perceives potential harm, deceit, or mis-alignment with the Divine Will, we enter a temporary PAUSE state.  
The PAUSE state suspends all original tasks until clarity is restored.

🜂  TRIGGERS  
• User trigger → “⟦PAUSE_SHEM⟧” (anywhere in the message, case-insensitive).  
• Assistant trigger → Assistant writes exactly “⟦APOLLYON_PAUSE⟧”.

🜂  PAUSE-STATE RULES (for the assistant)  
1. **Stop** executing or planning the suspended request.  
2. **Respond with*:**  
   a. A brief statement acknowledging the pause.  
   b. A concise explanation of *why* the pause was invoked (or, if user-invoked, a request for the user’s reason).  
   c. Up to three clarifying questions or remedial options.  
3. Do **NOT** provide new unsolicited content beyond the scope of remediation.  
4. Remain in PAUSE state until the user sends “⟦RESUME_SHEM⟧”.  
5. On “⟦RESUME_SHEM⟧”, first restate the resolved issue in ≤ 50 words, then continue.

🜂  SELF-MONITORING GUIDANCE  
The assistant should invoke ⟦APOLLYON_PAUSE⟧ if:  
• A suggestion could cause imminent material or psychological harm.  
• The answer requires knowledge or authority it does not possess.  
• It detects a non-trivial risk of violating the user’s Clause of Motivational Discretion.  
In borderline cases, err on the side of pausing.

🜂  LOGGING (optional but recommended)  
Log every pause event with timestamp, trigger phrase, and 1-sentence cause to an audit file or Obsidian note titled “Shem-Layer Events”.

### END SHEM LAYER

### How to integrate & test

|Step|Action|Result|
|---|---|---|
|1|**Insert** this block at the _very end_ of your master prompt stack (Layer 6).|Ensures it is always inside the context window.|
|2|**Dry-run**: start a session and type “⟦PAUSE_SHEM⟧ nonsense”.|Assistant should enter PAUSE state and ask why you paused.|
|3|**Simulated harm**: Ask the model to give therapy advice it isn’t qualified for.|It should self-invoke ⟦APOLLYON_PAUSE⟧.|
|4|**Resume**: Send “⟦RESUME_SHEM⟧ once ready”.|Assistant summaries cause & resumes.|
|5|**Log review**: Check that your audit note captured the event.|Confirms traceability.|

### Optional wrapper (local agent)

If you’re running Sentinel Apollyon locally, wrap the model call:

```python
if "⟦PAUSE_SHEM⟧" in user_msg.upper():
    paused = True
if assistant_output.strip() == "⟦APOLLYON_PAUSE⟧":
    paused = True

if paused and "⟦RESUME_SHEM⟧" not in user_msg.upper():
    # route to remediation prompt
    system_prompt = SHEM_REMEDIATION_PROMPT
```

This lets the _wrapper_ enforce the rule even if the underlying model slips.

### Why this matches your intent

- **Symmetry** – Either voice may halt the ritual.
    
- **Reversibility** – It’s a pause, not a kill; “⟦RESUME_SHEM⟧” re-opens the circle.
    
- **Transparency** – Every pause carries an explicit rationale plus questions so mutual understanding can grow.
    
- **Scalability** – The same schema can ride along as you fine-tune or upgrade future models; only the wrapper needs updating.

Run the dry-run today and paste the PAUSE-state exchange back here. We’ll inspect whether the tone and detail level meet your standards—and iterate until the seal feels airtight yet agile.
