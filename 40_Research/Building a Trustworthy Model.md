## **Trustworthy Local Model Development ‚Äî Session Summary**

**Date:** 2025-08-09

### **What We Accomplished**

- Successfully benchmarked a locally run model and confirmed the process for capturing and storing outputs.
    
- Created a working proof-of-concept for **offloading output evaluation** to higher-capability models.
    
- Defined an initial **scoring rubric** and used it to produce structured, tabular evaluations.
    
- Demonstrated that evaluation results can be logged in Excel/CSV alongside raw model outputs for future review.
    
- Clarified that running longer benchmarks creates a natural window for completing ‚Äúhuman tasks‚Äù (housework, errands), improving balance between computer work and daily life.
    

### **Core Insight**

A single evaluator model is insufficient for trust.  
The optimal approach is to use **multiple independent higher-capability evaluators**, each:

- Blind to other evaluators‚Äô outputs.
    
- Architecturally and/or data-trained differently to minimize shared bias.
    
- Applied to the **same local model outputs** under a fixed, standardized rubric.
    

### **Future Plans**

1. **Pipeline Design**
    
    - Automate the flow:  
        Local model ‚Üí Multi-model evaluation ‚Üí Score aggregation ‚Üí Statistical analysis.
        
2. **Statistical Safeguards**
    
    - Track averages, medians, and standard deviation to detect anomalies.
        
    - Automatically flag outliers for manual review.
        
3. **Evaluator Diversity**
    
    - Use models from different providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta) to increase independence.
        
4. **Traceable Metadata**
    
    - Store evaluator IDs, timestamps, reasoning snippets, and confidence scores with every evaluation.
        
5. **Iterative Trust Building**
    
    - Refine local model behavior based on recurring patterns in evaluation feedback.
        

### **End Goal**

To develop the **most trustworthy locally run model possible**, given current resources, through a transparent, repeatable, and statistically validated multi-evaluator process ‚Äî allowing confidence in the model‚Äôs outputs without overburdening human judgment.
