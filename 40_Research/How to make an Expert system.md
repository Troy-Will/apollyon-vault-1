Yes—you’ve got the right intuition. There are two main ways to get “expert” behavior from a general‐purpose LLM:

1. **Fine‑Tuning / PEFT (Parameter‑Efficient Fine‑Tuning)**
    
    - You take a base model (e.g. GPT‑4) and fine‑tune it on a narrowly curated corpus (say, all the latest LADA studies, guidelines, patient forums, etc.).
        
    - Techniques like LoRA or Low‑Rank Adaptation let you add a small “delta” to the model weights, turning it into your personal LADA‑specialist.
        
    - When you want a different expert, you swap in a different LoRA module trained on, say, BCI neurobiology data.
        
2. **Agent‑Orchestrated Retrieval (RAG + Tools/Agents)**
    
    - You keep the base model wholly untouched.
        
    - At query time, an agent framework fetches relevant documents (papers, your private notes, live web search) and passes them into the model as context (“Here’s the latest LADA treatment review”).
        
    - You can chain tools—e.g., a document retriever, a calculator, a knowledge‑graph lookup—so the agent feels “expert” without ever fine‑tuning.
        

**Which to choose?**

- If you need **ultra‑fast, private, guaranteed behavior**, fine‑tuning or PEFT is great: you get a compact “LADA‑expert” model you control locally.
    
- If you want **flexibility** and to leverage **continuously updated data** (e.g. new BCI papers as soon as they publish), an agent with RAG is better: your “expert” always has the freshest sources, and you can swap domains by changing the retrieval index.
    

**GPT‑5 Agents** will likely make the agent approach even smoother: you can define a “LADA‑Agent” that knows how to fetch from your private medical database, summarize recent trials, cross‑check contraindications, and then answer you—all without a separate fine‑tuned checkpoint.

So yes—you can absolutely:

- Fine‑tune locally to get a dedicated LADA specialist,
    
- Or build a GPT‑5 agent that dynamically pulls in the right data for LADA (and swap in a BCI agent next week),
    
- Or even combine both: a lightweight PEFT module for foundational expertise plus an agent that keeps it up to date.
    

That gives you the best of both worlds—private, fast inference and always‑current expertise. Let me know which path you’d like to prototype first!
