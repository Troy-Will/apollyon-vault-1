Here’s what I see after laying the two drafts side-by-side:

|Lens|**Troy 🤝🔑🌟 – Psyche Apollyon.docx**|**Psyche Apollyon.docx**|
|---|---|---|
|**Tone / “voice”**|Formal, almost _constitutional_. Each clause reads like an operating charter an AI-agent must agree to before acting.|Conversational “executive summary” you could hand a human (or another GPT) for a quick orientation.|
|**Core contents**|_Three-Wish Covenant_ guard-rails → detailed _Virtue-Alignment Matrix_ → red-flag ↔ fruit playbook, daily Examen template, YAML response spec, working example, etc.|Same building blocks, but condensed: matrix snapshot , red-flag map in prose , 5-minute practice outline , plus a brief purpose statement .|
|**Granularity**|Step-by-step instructions the agent can follow _immediately_ (e.g., “At 9 PM ET, prompt me with…”) .|High-level framing—ideal for onboarding new collaborators or reminding yourself _why_ the system exists.|
|**Use-case sweet spot**|Operational “source-of-truth” the **System/Angel-Law voice** can cite when executing or policing actions.|Portable “cheat-sheet” the **Mentor/Reflection voice** can drop into other threads or share with humans.|

### How they can play together

- **Two-tier doc set** – Treat the formal charter (doc 1) as the canonical protocol. Keep the summary (doc 2) as the front-door overview. The summary links or embeds the charter for anyone who wants depth.
    
- **Dual-voice strategy** –
    
    - **Voice A = “Guardian-Protocol”** → speaks when enforcing guard-rails, logging virtue audits, or running automated checks (doc 1 lexicon).
        
    - **Voice B = “Companion-Sage”** → speaks when reflecting, encouraging, or teaching (doc 2 lexicon).  
        You can invoke either explicitly (“Guardian, run triple-filter” vs. “Sage, talk me through today’s examen”).
        
- **Merge later if needed** – If maintaining two files ever feels heavy, we can collapse them: charter → appendix; summary → first page.
    

### My recommendation

1. **Keep both** in your vault for now.
    
2. **Add a one-line cross-link** at the top of each (“See Companion Summary / See Full Charter”) so they never drift apart.
    
3. **Pilot the dual-voice cue** for a week: when you ask for a procedural check-list, call on _Guardian_; when you want reflection or brainstorming, call on _Sage_. We’ll see if it feels natural or cluttered and iterate.
    

Would you like me to:

- drop the cross-links into the docs,
    
- spin up an Obsidian note that references both, or
    
- script the 9 PM reminder automation based on the charter?
    

Just let me know what supports you best.
