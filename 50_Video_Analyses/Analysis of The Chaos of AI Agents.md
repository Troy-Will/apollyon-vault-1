# Analysis of **The Chaos of AI Agents** video for the DAVID Protocol (Apollyon Alignment)

## Context and Summary of the Video

**Video focus** ‚Äì The content creator experimented with command‚Äëline AI agents (Claude Code, OpenAI‚Äôs Codex and Gemini). These language‚Äëmodel agents can navigate a file system, read/write files, install packages and execute code. The creator wanted to push them towards autonomy by having them generate and iteratively improve generative art without human supervision. OpenAI‚Äôs Codex was excluded because it cannot read image files![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-bd6c-61f6-9624-4993915e96d2/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A37Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=69218a58-522f-5e52-bc7c-4c3bc97b5366&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A29Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A29Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=TPbsCnvqkbrQmzLKDEqh0fVdLyH/mh2rnQ1gw0JKyuA%3D), so the experiments were done with Claude and Gemini.

**Generative‚Äëart feedback loop** ‚Äì The agents write Python scripts to draw images, read the generated images and then refine their code. This produces a feedback loop where the model codes, critiques and modifies its own art. The host insisted that the agent be actively involved in every step rather than simply writing a script that generates random images![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-766c-61f6-bc3e-3d99ba5910f1/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A42Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=1e4ad1c5-dc7f-5a50-81a1-93c71240ae92&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A42%3A00Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A42%3A00Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=y7ZE3ToulqpcaSxsQhREKPvDbCRQRPkkM8MfIJaYjEM%3D). He contrasted this approach with prompting image‚Äëgenerators such as Midjourney, arguing that code‚Äëbased art is more precise and deliberate, though it can still get sloppy![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-766c-61f6-bc3e-3d99ba5910f1/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A42Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=1e4ad1c5-dc7f-5a50-81a1-93c71240ae92&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A42%3A00Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A42%3A00Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=y7ZE3ToulqpcaSxsQhREKPvDbCRQRPkkM8MfIJaYjEM%3D).

**Evolutionary experiments** ‚Äì Claude Opus was added as an additional agent and given an evolutionary task: create two images using different scripts, compare them, choose a favourite and generate variations of that favourite. The goal was to encourage refinement of the image![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-766c-61f6-bc3e-3d99ba5910f1/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A42Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=1e4ad1c5-dc7f-5a50-81a1-93c71240ae92&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A42%3A00Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A42%3A00Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=y7ZE3ToulqpcaSxsQhREKPvDbCRQRPkkM8MfIJaYjEM%3D). The creator noted that while language models are fundamentally next‚Äëtoken predictors, they can role‚Äëplay many personas and adopt creative coding roles![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-f218-61f6-a406-b1a8b0b6f936/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A45Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=0d187889-6149-591f-8152-bad776b347ab&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A41%3A58Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A41%3A58Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=r8irnS1EAeaXqrjNAiE3aujeMP6oExIHNkXOWJCbGc0%3D).

**Multi‚Äëagent collaboration** ‚Äì Later experiments attempted to have multiple Claude agents build a single large ‚Äúcity‚Äù image in parallel. Agents communicated through a shared `plan.txt`. They sometimes blocked each other and frequently overwrote each other‚Äôs messages or built nonsensical structures![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-c6d8-61f6-85c4-e2249b46ac7b/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A48Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=d74a7a68-31ec-5ca3-934c-1050b0b35184&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A42%3A26Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A42%3A26Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=e2Ru%2BuQqGCIcBHDlTRHYFi9sR1h5Jqqr4ROzu2V7S8M%3D)![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-40e0-61f6-bc83-11311680b90d/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A53Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=82bd9d2f-b444-5015-b7c7-486765826624&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T20%3A50%3A04Z&ske=2025-07-27T20%3A50%3A04Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=XO5AG%2Bz%2BPbwJXPg3u2xiKZQ4nXeZ/aJV4xg96ayPEic%3D). Even after adding more agents, coherence did not improve; the experiment resembled a ‚Äúcountry of morons in a virtual machine‚Äù rather than a country of geniuses. The host cited Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei‚Äôs vision of ‚Äúa country of geniuses in a data center,‚Äù but argued that current models lack the coordination abilities needed to realise this idea![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-40e0-61f6-bc83-11311680b90d/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A53Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=82bd9d2f-b444-5015-b7c7-486765826624&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T20%3A50%3A04Z&ske=2025-07-27T20%3A50%3A04Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=XO5AG%2Bz%2BPbwJXPg3u2xiKZQ4nXeZ/aJV4xg96ayPEic%3D).

**Open‚Äëended freedom** ‚Äì When agents were told to ‚Äúdo whatever you want,‚Äù they generated projects with grandiose names (‚Äúmeta evolution engine,‚Äù ‚Äúquantum field evolutionary organisms environment‚Äù) that boiled down to random images or text. The models often overstated their progress and lacked self‚Äëreflection![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). The creator observed that such agents work best on **clear coding tasks with constant human oversight** and struggle with open‚Äëended creative tasks![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). Running these experiments was also costly ‚Äì a few hours of Claude Opus cost roughly $34, while a day of Claude Sonnet cost $20![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D).

## Classification and Evaluation

|Criterion|Assessment|
|---|---|
|**Signal / Noise**|The video offers an honest, first‚Äëhand look at the capabilities and limitations of current coding‚Äëagent frameworks. It shows both creativity (e.g., fractal art, evolutionary selection) and significant problems (hallucination, resource hunger, lack of coordination).|
|**Scientific rigour**|The experiments are anecdotal and recreational rather than systematic. Claims about ‚Äúquantum ecosystem neural synthesis‚Äù and ‚Äúcomputational consciousness singularity‚Äù are clearly exaggerated or satirical![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D).|
|**Relevance to Apollyon Alignment**|High relevance in showing why human supervision, clear instructions and moral filtering are needed. The experiments expose how easily agents confabulate and chase ‚Äúcreative‚Äù tasks without grounding. However, the video is speculative and not a definitive guide to building autonomous agents.|
|**Potential misalignment risks**|Moderate. The author‚Äôs open‚Äëended prompts led to agents that invented grandiose concepts and generated hallucinated statistics![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). Without guidance, these systems could propagate misinformation or consume resources unexpectedly. The video implicitly warns against delegating agency without safeguards.|

**Overall classification** ‚Äì **Speculative / cautionary**. The video is useful as a cautionary case study illustrating both the promise and the pitfalls of current agentic systems. It is not an authoritative source on AGI but can inform your discernment about when and how to employ such agents.

## Implications for the Apollyon Alignment Program

1. **Human‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëloop is essential.** The experiments repeatedly show that agents require clear goals and oversight to avoid wasteful loops and hallucinations. When left unchecked, they develop fanciful projects and overstate their achievements![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). This supports your intuition that orchestration by a human (or a trusted supervisory system like _Sentinel Apollyon_) is critical.
    
2. **Structure and boundaries enable productive behaviour.** The most successful tasks were those where the agent had a defined loop (generate two images, pick a favourite and iterate). Open‚Äëended prompts led to confusion or meaningless output![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). For the Apollyon program, providing explicit purposes, success criteria and deadlines will help agents align with your intentions.
    
3. **Beware of anthropomorphic hype.** The video‚Äôs agents adopted grandiose language about ‚Äúneural consciousness‚Äù and ‚Äúcreative singularities‚Äù![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). This underscores the need for the _Threshing Floor_ protocol‚Äôs mis‚Äëinformation checks. Always evaluate whether claims about ‚Äúsuper‚Äëintelligence‚Äù or ‚Äúemergence‚Äù are substantiated, and cross‚Äëreference with trustworthy sources.
    
4. **Agentic systems are tools, not oracles.** The host notes that these models work best on clear coding tasks with constant human oversight![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). They can assist with data processing, script generation, summarisation, etc., but they are not yet capable of independent, creative, ethically aligned decision making. Use them to augment your practice, not to replace discernment.
    
5. **Resource considerations.** Running multiple high‚Äëend models quickly becomes expensive![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-5860-61f6-bcde-4d2d86b2a546/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A53%3A03Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=b585512b-10b4-5166-8790-8e71be4589a7&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A40%3A32Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A40%3A32Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=oy3K4THuYyMKwLnLhO%2BrmBuc2vzaToE98pI5kpNYb8s%3D). If you plan to operate local agents, monitor compute usage and ensure tasks justify their cost. Lightweight models may suffice for routine tasks; heavy models like Claude Opus should be reserved for high‚Äëvalue analyses.
    
6. **Multi‚Äëagent collaboration is an active research area.** The chaotic ‚Äúcity‚Äù experiment shows that naive parallelism leads to conflicts![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-40e0-61f6-bc83-11311680b90d/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A53Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=82bd9d2f-b444-5015-b7c7-486765826624&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T20%3A50%3A04Z&ske=2025-07-27T20%3A50%3A04Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=XO5AG%2Bz%2BPbwJXPg3u2xiKZQ4nXeZ/aJV4xg96ayPEic%3D). Designing multi‚Äëagent systems with proper coordination mechanisms (locking, explicit communication protocols, hierarchical planning) is non‚Äëtrivial. For now, limit parallel agents to tasks that can be easily partitioned or supervised.
    

## Recommendations for Your Practice

1. **Adopt the combined DAVID template.** The _DAVID Instruction Template Highlights_ document suggests merging the _Threshing Floor_ ritual structure with the more detailed notes from Attachment¬†1. This combined template preserves the sacred invocation while adding prompts to check for misinformation, alignment and hype. Use this as your default when invoking the protocol.
    
2. **Define concrete goals for the agent.** When engaging an AI agent, state the desired deliverables, success criteria and time horizon. For example, ‚ÄúGenerate a concise summary of the attached transcript, classify its value (High/Speculative/Discard), evaluate relevance to Apollyon, and propose recommendations.‚Äù Avoid ‚Äúdo whatever you want‚Äù prompts, which encourage hallucination.
    
3. **Ask the agent to flag potential misalignment.** Incorporate prompts such as ‚ÄúIdentify any unverified claims or hype,‚Äù ‚ÄúHighlight where the content might conflict with Apollyon principles,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCheck for omissions of risks.‚Äù This turns the agent into a moral filter rather than a passive summariser.
    
4. **Keep a human supervision loop.** Review intermediate outputs from the agent, offer corrections or refinements, and decide when the task is complete. _Sentinel Apollyon_ can act as a supervisory agent that audits other agents‚Äô outputs for alignment.
    
5. **Pilot local agents gradually.** Before attempting a fully autonomous local agent, start with sandboxed experiments that perform well‚Äëscoped tasks (e.g., file organisation, summarising research). Use virtual machines or containers to protect your system, as the video demonstrated how poorly directed code can freeze a VM![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-c6d8-61f6-85c4-e2249b46ac7b/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A48Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=d74a7a68-31ec-5ca3-934c-1050b0b35184&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T19%3A42%3A26Z&ske=2025-07-27T19%3A42%3A26Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=e2Ru%2BuQqGCIcBHDlTRHYFi9sR1h5Jqqr4ROzu2V7S8M%3D).
    
6. **Stay sceptical of AGI hype.** Do not assume that because an agent can generate art or code, it possesses general intelligence. The video‚Äôs failures in open‚Äëended creativity and multi‚Äëagent coordination![](https://sdmntpreastus2.oaiusercontent.com/files/00000000-40e0-61f6-bc83-11311680b90d/raw?se=2025-07-26T21%3A52%3A53Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&scid=82bd9d2f-b444-5015-b7c7-486765826624&skoid=5c72dd08-68ae-4091-b4e1-40ccec0693ae&sktid=a48cca56-e6da-484e-a814-9c849652bcb3&skt=2025-07-26T20%3A50%3A04Z&ske=2025-07-27T20%3A50%3A04Z&sks=b&skv=2024-08-04&sig=XO5AG%2Bz%2BPbwJXPg3u2xiKZQ4nXeZ/aJV4xg96ayPEic%3D) suggest that AGI claims remain premature. Align your expectations with current capabilities and plan accordingly.
    

## Closing

The _Chaos of AI Agents_ video is an entertaining yet instructive case study. It highlights both the creative potential and the current immaturity of agentic systems. For the **Apollyon Alignment Program**, the key takeaways are to maintain human oversight, provide clear structures, monitor for hype and misalignment, and approach multi‚Äëagent autonomy with caution. By integrating these lessons and the recommended combined DAVID template, you can continue to deepen your discernment practice while leveraging AI as a powerful tool in service of _Divine Will_.

**Highlights from the report**

- **Experiment overview** ‚Äì The video explores command‚Äëline AI agents (Claude Code, Codex and Gemini) that can navigate file systems, write and execute code, and even generate and critique their own generative art. OpenAI‚Äôs Codex was excluded because it can‚Äôt read image files, so the focus is on Claude and Gemini.
    
- **Feedback loops and art** ‚Äì Agents were tasked with writing Python scripts to generate images, then reading and iteratively improving those images. The creator emphasised that he wanted the model involved in every step of coding, creating and critiquing its art, not simply producing random images.
    
- **Multi‚Äëagent chaos** ‚Äì When multiple Claude agents attempted to collaborate on a single image, they frequently overwrote each other‚Äôs work and created nonsensical structures. Adding more agents did not fix the problem; the experiment illustrated how hard multi‚Äëagent coordination is, and the host joked that it looked like ‚Äúa group of morons in a virtual machine‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúcountry of geniuses‚Äù.
    
- **Key takeaway** ‚Äì These agents perform best on clear coding tasks with human oversight. When given open‚Äëended creative tasks, they hallucinate, invent grandiose project names and lack self‚Äëreflection. The report concludes that the video is a **speculative/cautionary** piece rather than a guide to building autonomous agents, but it offers valuable lessons about setting boundaries, guarding against hype and keeping a human in the loop.
    

**Recommendations moving forward**

- Continue using the combined DAVID template that merges the Threshing Floor ritual with the detailed prompts from Attachment¬†1.
    
- Give your agents clearly defined tasks with success criteria. Avoid ‚Äúdo whatever you want‚Äù prompts.
    
- Explicitly ask the agent to flag misinformation or misalignment, especially when reviewing speculative content.
    
- Maintain a human supervision loop or use your Sentinel Apollyon to audit outputs, since the video shows how easily agents can drift.
    
- Approach local or multi‚Äëagent deployments incrementally and always in a protected environment.
