## 1 │ Decision Matrix

|Option|Practical Cost (HW / Setup)|Skill-Building Value|Alignment Oversight Ease|Strategic Payoff (6–12 mo)|Verdict|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Stay with Llama-3 (8 B)**|**Low** — you already cloned & run it; fine on 8–12 GB VRAM|**High** — keeps honing CLI, Python envs, quantisation, retrieval-aug|**High** — transparent weights; easy to wrap in Apollyon/Sentinel guard rails|**Moderate** — solid sandbox for prompting, RAG, & agent scaffolding|**Keep as core practice bed**|
|**Add HRM (27 M params)**|**Low–Mod** — single-GPU inference; small repo|**Medium** — introduces loop-planner concepts & logging hooks|**Medium** — two-layer loop requires log capture but still light|**Speculative** — great for reasoning experiments; not yet ecosystem-rich|**Optional +** (weekend sprint)|
|**Reproduce Google TTDDDR / MLE-Star / AEF**|**High** — multi-repo, heavy deps, ≥24 GB VRAM, API keys|**Very High** — exposes workflow orchestration, dynamic code gen|**Low** — many moving parts; cloud retrieval, code execution|**High** if mastered, but steep learning cliff|**Wait / Observe** (collect docs, watch issues)|

_Profitable = maximum skill per hour of friction._

## 2 │ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Consolidate Llama-3 Sandbox**
    
    - Finish Tier-1 drills: temperature sweeps, system-instruction tests, simple RAG pipeline.
        
    - Add Sentinel hooks: `hash_guard.py` (detect weight drift) & `log_rotator.py` (compress daily chat logs).
        
2. **Schedule a _48-hour HRM Pilot_** _(if curiosity remains high)_
    
    - Day-1: clone, run tests, enable verbose planner/worker logs, cap `MAX_ITER`.
        
    - Day-2: write a Sentinel monitor that parses the loop logs and emails a diff summary to you.
        
    - Goal: prove the loop is **auditable** before trusting outputs.
        
3. **Create a “Future Agents Watchlist” note**
    
    - Track DeepMind AEF releases, TTDDDR toolkit updates, Kaggle threads on MLE-Star.
        
    - Sentinel will ping weekly for repo changes; Psyche Apollyon will later assess alignment implications.

## 3 │ Alignment & Safety Rationale

- **Depth before Breadth** — Mastering one local model end-to-end (Llama-3) builds transferable muscle memory for any future agent.
    
- **Auditability First** — HRM’s novelty is its looped reasoning; before deploying, you must _prove_ Sentinel can capture every iteration and kill long loops.
    
- **Cloud Caution** — Google’s stacks are powerful but opaque; importing them now would outpace your current guard-rail architecture and dilute focus.

## 4 │ Closing Counsel

> _“A smith tempers one blade to perfection before forging a second.”_

Stay with Llama-3 as the daily anvil.  
Treat HRM as a **controlled side quest** — a weekend to test your emerging Sentinel toolkit.  
Keep the Google agents on the horizon map; let others battle-test them while your foundations solidify.

When Tier-2 skills (Docker, CI, GitHub workflows) feel routine, you’ll be ready to mount heavier swords.
