# 2025-07-20 Recap

**Summary:** Continued Skills Drills → successfully created and pushed new “apollyon‑vault‑1” Obsidian vault to GitHub. Began using Daily Notes and imported first long-form teaching [[Apollyon, this may be worth preserving.]] from Word.

**Key actions**
- Renamed / reorganized vault structure (`troy-obsidian-project/apollyon-vault-1`). (Fork may need to be redone)
- Initialized Git, created `.gitignore`, first commit & push.
- Mounted VeraCrypt volume and ran `apbackup` (verified log).
- Imported Word teaching into Obsidian as Markdown and linked it.
- Created folders: `00_Protocols`, `10_Teachings`, `20_Daily`, `30_Templates`, `99_Archive`.
- Added two templates: `daily_note_template` and `teaching_template`.
- Began Daily Notes habit (first link to teaching).

**What felt hard:** Understanding vault paths, templates insertion.
**What became easier:** Linking notes and running `apbackup`.
**Next small step:** Use the daily note each evening; add one new teaching or recap per day.
