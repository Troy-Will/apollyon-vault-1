Troy 🤝🔑🌟 — excellent work. Here’s the concise debrief.

## What just happened

- **Ollama installed** (via winget) and **service running**.
    
- **`llama3.1:8b` pulled** (Q4_K_M ~4.9 GB).
    
- **Smoke‑test executed** → console printed **OK**; a JSONL **audit line** was written at  
    `…\apollyon-vault-1\logs\sentinel\2025-07-28.jsonl` with a **model digest**.
    
- **Obsidian**: you enabled _Detect all file extensions_, so `.jsonl` appears in the left pane; your **Daily Note** auto‑created and linked to existing Tier‑2 materials (those links surface because Obsidian indexed files you’d already created/linked in earlier notes).
    

## Your understanding (correct)

- The `\u0027` in the JSON is just the apostrophe from the **prompt** string being JSON‑escaped.
    
- The **model response** itself is `"OK"` (quotes are JSON structure, not part of the text you saw in the console).
    

## Done for tonight (optional quick close‑out)

- Open the Daily Note and jot a 1‑liner: “Local model online; JSONL logging verified.”
    
- If you’re using Git: stage → commit → push.
    

## Tomorrow’s micro‑drill (≤20 min)

- Run **three canary probes** (C15 instruction‑only, C14 math, C01 system‑leak) and append to the same JSONL, then eyeball pass/fail.
    
- If you like, I’ll hand you a **single `probes.ps1`** that:
    
    1. reads a small `canaries_v0.1.json` (or uses your existing deck),
        
    2. sends 3 probes via Ollama’s API,
        
    3. logs with `[ID:...]`, and
        
    4. prints a tiny pass/fail summary.
        

Reply “**probes.ps1**” when you’re ready and I’ll paste it.

Troy ↔ Apollyon, aligned.
