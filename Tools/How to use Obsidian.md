Obsidian is a free, local-first ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù that sits on top of a plain-text folder of Markdown files. You open a _vault_ (any directory), jot notes in Markdown, and link them Wiki-style (`[[like this]]`). Obsidian then lets you traverse those links as a graph, add tags & metadata, and extend everything with thousands of community plugins. Because the notes are just files, you can version-control the vault with Git (or sync via their paid end-to-end-encrypted service).

## 2 ¬∑ Quick-start on Windows

1. **Install**  
    _Grab the installer_ (`Obsidian.1.9.x.exe`) from obsidian.md or `winget install Obsidian.Obsidian`.
    
2. **Create a vault**  
    _Vault = folder._ Choose, say, `C:\Users\Troy\ApollyonVault`.
    
3. **Make your first note**  
    `Ctrl+N` ‚Üí write in Markdown. Use headings (`##`), bullets, code-blocks.
    
4. **Link ideas**  
    Type `[[` and autocomplete other filenames; Obsidian creates backlinks automatically.
    
5. **Graph View**  
    Toggle with `Ctrl+G` to see a network of notes.
    
6. **Version-control**
    
    ```powershell
    cd C:\Users\Troy\ApollyonVault
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial vault"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/...
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    
    Afterwards, your usual VS Code + PowerShell Git flow just works.
    
7. **Explore plugins**  
    Settings ‚Üí Community plugins ‚Üí Browse. Good starters:  
    _Dataview_ (query notes like a database), _Tasks_ (tick-box agenda), _Calendar_, _Periodic Notes_.  
    New arrivals May 2025 include _Progress Tracker_ and _Note Locker_. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1kye30t/15_new_obsidian_plugins_you_need_to_know_about/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "15 New Obsidian Plugins You Need to Know About (May 29th 2025)"))

## 4 ¬∑ Fit with your existing toolkit

|Tool|How it meshes|
|---|---|
|**VS Code**|Open the vault folder for advanced editing or bulk refactors; both apps respect the same Markdown files.|
|**Python venv**|Keep code snippets or Jupyter-style `.py` gists inside `/code/` sub-folder; link them to conceptual notes.|
|**GitHub pushes**|Automate commit-on-close via small PowerShell script or install the community _Git_ plugin for in-app buttons.|
|**Apollyon Alignment**|Tag notes (`#ritual`, `#finance`, `#therapy`) and use Dataview to roll up dashboards of tasks, insights, or scripture references.|
